# Red Team Operations:

I have built a new Linux Distro downloadable here:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HFQxVrMlwihJTmZq7MYWnIW-lBw8_I0v

The image was captured with dd, so use it or use Rufus (dd mode) to create a bootable media.

Some info:
- Only 7 GB media is required

- Almost all packets are at the latest version

- Armitage preinstalled

- ZAP Preinstalled

- All connections are redirected through Tor automatically

To login in the system, enter the following credentials:

- Username: ubuntu

- Password: ubuntu

I'm building a website for this Linux distro, so stay tuned...
