    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>The Managed environment, also referred to as Enterprise, comprises centrally managed IT products,
everything ranging from servers and printers to desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets. Managed
checklists are intended for advanced end users and system administrators. The managed nature of typical
Managed environments gives administrators centralized control over various settings on devices.
Authentication, account, and policy management can also be administered centrally to maintain a
consistent security posture across an organization.

The Managed environment is more restrictive and provides less functionality than the Standalone
environment. However, because of the supported and controlled8 nature of the Managed environment, it
is typically easier to use more functionally restrictive settings in Managed environments than in
Standalone environments. Managed environments also tend to implement several layers of defense (e.g.,
firewalls, antivirus servers, IDSs, patch management systems, and email filtering), which provides greater
protection for systems.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="RichTextBox2.Text" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A Custom environment contains systems in which the functionality and degree of security do not fit the
other types of environments. Specialized Security-Limited Functionality (SSLF) is a typical Custom
environment that is highly restrictive and secure; it is usually reserved for systems that have the highest
threats and associated impacts. Typical examples of such systems are outward-facing web, email, and
DNS servers, other publicly accessed systems, and firewalls. It also encompasses computers that contain
confidential information (e.g., central repository of personnel records, medical records, and financial
information) or that perform vital organizational functions (e.g., accounting, payroll processing, and air
traffic control). These systems might be targeted by third parties for exploitation, but also might be
targeted by trusted parties inside the organization. Because systems in an SSLF environment are at high
risk of attack or data exposure, security takes precedence over functionality. The systems’ data content or
mission purpose is of such value that aggressive tradeoffs in favor of security outweigh the potential
negative consequences to other useful system attributes such as legacy applications or interoperability
with other systems.
An SSLF environment could be a subset of another environment. For example, three desktops in a
Managed environment that hold the organization’s confidential employee data could be thought of as an
SSLF environment within a Managed environment. In addition, a laptop used by a mobile worker (e.g.,
organization management) might be an SSLF environment in a Standalone environment. An SSLF
environment might also be a self-contained environment outside any other environment, such as a
government security installation processing sensitive data.
SSLF checklists are intended for experienced security specialists and seasoned system administrators who
understand the impact of implementing strict technical security practices. If home users and other users
who do not have security expertise attempt to apply SSLF checklists to their systems, they typically
experience unwanted limitations on system functionality and cause possibly irreparable system damage</value>
